# NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a popular open-source library for the Python programming language. 
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, 
along with an extensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays en.wikipedia.org. 
In simpler terms, NumPy lets you efficiently store and manipulate numerical data (like numbers in a grid or table) in Python. 
It serves as a foundation for many data science and scientific computing libraries, 
and is widely used in fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research medium.com
